# Superstore Profitability Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project was undertaken as a consultant tasked with reviewing Superstore's sales operations and helping the company increase profitability and avoid bankruptcy. Using transactional data from the "superstore.xls" datasetâ€”including information on products, orders, shipping, and returnsâ€”this analysis identifies key profit drivers, areas of loss, advertising opportunities, and risk factors due to product returns. Visualizations and metrics are used to support data-driven decisions and strategic recommendations.

#### Data Source
 - Tableau superstore dataset

 
 #### Tools used 
 - Excel- data source 
 - Tableau for data visualization.

### Part 1: Profits & Losses
- Identified **top 2 most profitable dimension pairs**, such as *Sub-Category + Region* and *Product ID + Shipping Mode*.
- Detected **top 2 loss-making combinations**, highlighting areas for review or discontinuation.
- Highlighted **specific loss-generating products** (e.g., certain office supply items) that consistently underperform.
- Selected **3 profitable subcategories** (e.g., Copiers, Phones, Accessories) to focus on.
- Recommended **3 subcategories to avoid** (e.g., Binders, Tables, Bookcases) based on repeated losses.

### Part 2: Advertising Strategy
- Analyzed **average profit by state and month** to identify seasonality.
- Recommended **top 3 combinations of state + month** (e.g., Indiana in October, Vermont in November) for advertising investment.
- Calculated **advertising budget** using Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) modelâ€”1/5 of monthly profit as ad spend.
- Visualized **monthly trends** in profit across key states.

### Part 3: Returned Items
- **LEFT JOIN** performed between Orders and Returns tables to assess return rates.
- Created a calculated field for return status (`Returned = 1` for Yes, `0` for Null).
- Identified **high-return products** and **frequent-return customers**.
- Compared **average return rate vs. profit** across dimensions like product category and shipping mode.
- Visuals reveal that some products with high returns may still be profitable, warranting case-by-case evaluation.

## ðŸ§  Conclusions

1. **Profits are highly concentrated** in a few key combinations of product category and region.
2. **Losses are persistent** in certain subcategories and products that should be reviewed or discontinued.
3. **Advertising in Q4** (especially October and November) across a few high-performing states yields better returns.
4. **Customer returns** vary significantly by product and shipping mode, and not all high-return items are unprofitable.
5. **Subcategory-level performance** shows clear winners and underperformers, enabling sharper inventory decisions.

## âœ… Recommendations

### Profitability Actions
- Discontinue or re-evaluate products and subcategories showing consistent losses.
- Focus resources on high-margin, high-profit areas like Copiers and Phones.

### Advertising Strategy
- Launch targeted advertising in **Indiana**, **Vermont**, and **Rhode Island** during Q4.
- Use a **20% of profit** threshold to set ad budgets based on average monthly profit.

### Return Rate Management
- Reduce returns by improving shipping processes (e.g., evaluating "Same Day" shipping mode).
- Investigate and improve or eliminate high-return products with low profitability.

### Business Strategy
- Encourage **positive reviews** and improved service to boost product ratings.
- Promote **high-rated items** more aggressively, as ratings have a positive correlation with sales.
- Tailor promotions for demographic groups like **students** who show higher engagement.
